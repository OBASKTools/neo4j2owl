# OWL 2 EL <-> Neo4J Mapping

This is a preliminary draft of our Neo4J to OWL mapping. The goal is to be able to import OWL 2 EL ontologies in and export them from Neo4J in such a way that entailments and annotations are preserved (not however the syntactic structure). For now, the draft only addresses a subset of OWL 2 EL.
